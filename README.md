# ML Study Notes

Welcome to the **ML Study Notes** repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring and explaining various machine learning concepts through a series of Medium posts.Because I believe you learn best by teaching people. Each post is accompanied by detailed explanations, code examples, and visualizations to enhance understanding.

## Repository Structure

- **`contents/`**: Contains individual directories for each Medium post, including the post content, code examples, and relevant images.
- **`LICENSE`**: Licensing information for the repository.

## Getting Started

1. **Explore**: Navigate to the `contents/` directory to find different topics covered in the Medium posts or find all the links below.
2. **Read**: Each post directory contains a `README.md` with specific details about the post's content and usage.
3. **Code**: Check out the code examples and visualizations within each post directory to see practical applications of the concepts discussed.
